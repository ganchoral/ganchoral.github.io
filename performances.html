<h2 align="center"> Christmas 2015</h2>
<p>A full house of pre-Christmas revellers enjoyed the Society&#39;s November 29th Concert at the Firehall Theatre.</p>

<p>The concert, &quot;Christmas Around the World&quot;, featured carols and Christmas songs from England, Germany, Wales, Ukraine, Israel (!), and even a few from Canada.
 The finale was a Canadian rendition of the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, re-named to &quot;A Porcupine in a Pine Tree&quot;.</p>
 
<p>Aside from being delighted by the performance, the audience was treated to a mouth-watering assortment of Christmas treats. A great way to start the holiday season!</p>

<p>Attending the Choral Society&rsquo;s Christmas concert is a great start to the season!</p>

<p>Thirty members of the Society, accompanied by pianist Caroline Dowling, and directed by Anna Russell, entertained a full house at the Firehall Theatre.</p>

They presented many of our favourite carols such as &ldquo;White Christmas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo;, and &ldquo;O Come All Ye Faithful&rdquo;, and performed a number of popular melodies including &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; and Stan Rogers&rsquo; &rdquo;Northwest Passage&rdquo;. We audience members were encouraged to sing along a few times; fortunately they provided the words to the songs! Of course, humour was abundant, highlighted by the tune &ldquo;The Twelve Days AFTER Christmas&rdquo;. And who knew that Bach had twenty children?</p>

<p>Gananoque Choral Society is grateful for the support of local business, including<strong> Linda&rsquo;s TPI Clothing Boutique, Gan Shoe Outlet, Pharmasave, Moroni&rsquo;s Ristorante, Sears, Corner Stone Hairstylists, Spanish Villa Hairstylists, This That &amp; Everything, Donevan&rsquo;s Country Market, Woodley&rsquo;s Jeweller&rsquo;s, Dano&rsquo;s Pizza and Pita, Your Dollar Store With More, Computer Works</strong>, and <strong>Claudine Kirkby</strong>.THANK YOU!!</p>

<p>The Society performed two concerts this spring, one on Saturday evening at Gananoque Secondary School, and the other at Lansdowne United Church on a cold rainy Sunday afternoon in early May.</p>

<p>It warmed up in a hurry inside the church, though, as the singers had the audience clapping, tapping their feet and cheering, starting with the first song of their 20 song program themed &quot;Troubles by the Score&quot;. <img align="left" alt="" border="1" height=auto hspace="10" src="images/Spring_2014_goodies.jpg" vspace="10" width="250" />Favourites such as &quot;Mountain Music&quot;, &quot;Country Roads&quot;, &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, and Stompin&#39; Tom&#39;s &quot;Hockey Song&quot;. Most of the performances were presented in the choral tradition, interspersed with solos and duets by Choral Society members.</p>

<p>The complimentary snacks after the concert are always a hit!</p>

<p align="center"><img height=auto src="images/spring2011_1a_1.jpg" width="400" /></p>

<p>The Gananoque Choral Society produced a festive and traditional spring program on Saturday, May 7 in Gananoque at the Firehouse Hall and Sunday, May 8 in Lansdowne at the United Church.&nbsp; Exciting renditions included Canadian folk songs made popular by celebrities such as Anne Murray and KD Lang. Popular ballads such as &ldquo;The Mira&rdquo;, The Roll of the Sea&rdquo; and &quot;Alberta Bound&quot; were greatly enjoyed by the audience.&nbsp; And as a tribute to our friends in the lower 48, the group beautifully sang &ldquo;Bridge Over Troubled Water&rdquo;, newly composed in the choral manner by our director, Paul Arnold. Simon and Garfunkel would be proud!</p>
